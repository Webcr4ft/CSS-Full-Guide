# What Are Named Colors in CSS, and When to Use Them?

In CSS, **colors** are important because they help:

- Design web pages.
- Improve readability.
- Set the mood of a website.
- Improve the user experience.

One of the simplest ways to add colors in CSS is by using **named colors**.

## What Are Named Colors?

**Named colors** are predefined color names that web browsers understand.

For example:

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```

Here, `red` is a **named color**.

It tells the browser to make the paragraph text red.

Example:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```

## How Many Named Colors Are There?

CSS has **140 standard named colors**.

Some examples are:

- `red`
- `blue`
- `yellow`
- `aqua`
- `fuchsia`
- `black`
- `white`
- `green`
- `orange`
- `purple`
- `navy`
- `gray`

Named colors are easy to understand because their names usually describe the color directly.

For example:

```css
color: blue;
```

is easier to understand than:

```css
color: #0000ff;
```

## Why Use Named Colors?

Named colors are useful because they are:

- **Simple** to write.
- **Easy to remember.**
- **Easy to read.**
- **Self-descriptive.**

They are especially useful for:

- Quick prototypes.
- Simple websites.
- Testing designs.
- Improving code readability.

## Example With an `h1`

You can use named colors for both the text and background.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
```

```css
h1 {
  color: navy;
  background-color: lightgray;
}
```

Here:

- `navy` changes the heading's text color.
- `lightgray` changes the heading's background color.

The code is easy to understand because the color names immediately tell you what colors are being used.

## Advantages of Named Colors

### 1. Easy to Use

You can simply write the name of the color.

```css
color: red;
```

### 2. Easy to Read

Someone looking at your CSS can immediately understand the color.

```css
background-color: lightgray;
```

### 3. Good for Quick Designs

Named colors are useful when you need to quickly add colors without worrying about exact shades.

## Limitations of Named Colors

The main problem with named colors is that there are only **140 standard options**.

This means you cannot choose every possible shade.

For example, you might want a very specific shade of blue, but there may not be a named color that matches it exactly.

For more precise color control, you can use other color systems such as:

- **RGB**
- **HSL**
- **Hexadecimal colors**

You will learn more about these later.

## When Should You Use Named Colors?

Use named colors when:

- You are creating a **simple design**.
- You are **prototyping** a website.
- You need a color **quickly**.
- You want your CSS to be **easy to read**.
- You don't need a very specific shade.

Avoid relying only on named colors when:

- You need **precise colors**.
- You are creating a complex design.
- You need a specific brand color.
- You need many different shades of the same color.

## Key Things to Remember

> **Named colors** are predefined color names that CSS and browsers recognize.

There are **140 standard named colors** in CSS.

Example:

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```

Named colors are:

- **Simple**
- **Readable**
- **Easy to use**
- **Good for basic designs and prototypes**

But they are **limited** because there are only 140 standard options.

For more precise color control, use color systems such as **RGB, HSL, or hexadecimal colors**.
